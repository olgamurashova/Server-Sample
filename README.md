## Server Sample

### General information:

We use the response.writeHead()to attach some headers to the serverâ€™s response (status code and content type), response.write()writes to the web page. Then we use the response.end()to close the response to the server.
Lastly, we tell the server to listen at a port (3000). So we can at least see a demo of our web app while developing on our local machines. (localhost:3000). The listen method takes a callback as second argument. This callback fires immediately the server is started.
